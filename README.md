2. USAGE
--------

We have used the SMS Spam Collection Dataset for Testing and Training our classifier, we have decided to use the Dataset using the split ratio 1:3 (25% for testing and 75% for training).The Full dataset can be download either from : https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset or from the Github repo : https://github.com/Adithya12121992/SMSSpamClassification.git
